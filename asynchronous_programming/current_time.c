/*
    A parent creates a son, a grandchild, and a great-grandson.
    The great-grandson sends the current time received
    using system call "time" to the channel in binary form (time_t type).

    Father, son, and grandson read the time from the channel.
    The father process displays the string "Y:????",
    where ???? replaced with the current year, son â€” "M:??",
    where ?? are replaced with the current month of the year (from 1 to 12),
    the number is always output with two characters, the grandson is "D:??",
    where ?? replaced with the number of the day in the month,
    always output with two characters.

    The grandson should print the number first, the son - second,
    the father - third.
    Only a great-grandson is allowed to write to the channel. The parent must wait
    for all processes to complete and then terminate itself with code 0.

    Example output:
    D:11
    M:09
    Y:2001
